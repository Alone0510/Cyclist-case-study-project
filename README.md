**Summary of the insights gained from Tableau Visualization and SQL analysis**

-Casual riders/Customers are more concentrated around the coast area, whereas member/Subscribers riders are more spread out around the office area. Casual riders also peaked during weekends, there is a high chance they are tourists or families who are visiting the coastline for leisure activities such as sightseeing during the weekend. Longer average ride time for casual rider provide further suggestion on the previous mentioned point.


-Ridership start to pick up from February and start to decrease in August. It might have correlation to the seasonal changes. As the weather start to get warmer in February (start of Spring), more riders starts to cycle, and inversely when the weather to start to turn cold in August (end of Autumn)

-Length of ride for members are relatively shorter compared to casual riders. This might be due to short ride transit from train stations to their offices / home for member rider type.

- Numbers of rides during the year by casual riders are much less compared to members which indicates that the company is already having loyality amongst bike users.

- Weekend special members can be launched to attract Casual riders
